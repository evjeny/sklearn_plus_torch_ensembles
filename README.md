# sklearn + torch ensembles
Combining PyTorch models with Sklearn ensembles

It's better to run the notebook in [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), where the latest versions of libraries are installed.

However, there is a list of libraries' versions:
* numpy: 1.17.5
* scikit-learn: 0.22.1
* pytorch: 1.4.0
* matplotlib: 3.1.3
